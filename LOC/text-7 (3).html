First, it was </span><br /><span class="tx" style="top:82.82pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;">assumed that participants (and the demographic being represented) would have Internet access, </span> <span class="tx" style="top:110.42pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;padding-right:0.11em;">and therefore the study was advertised using online methods only. Second, it was assumed that </span> <span class="tx" style="top:138.02pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;">the subject of the content was irrelevant and therefore two TED talks were selected that were on </span> <span class="tx" style="top:165.62pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;padding-right:1.52em;">mundane and generally unfamiliar topics. Similarly, it was assumed that participants did not </span> <span class="tx" style="top:193.25pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;padding-right:2em;">have any prior knowledge of the content they read and watched. Third, it was assumed that </span> <span class="tx" style="top:220.85pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;">participants, once having started the study, would watch and read the full content and put forth a </span> <span class="tx" style="top:248.45pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:0.04em;padding-right:5.44em;">reasonable amount of effort to answer the comprehension questions that followed.  </span><br /><span class="tx" style="top:276.05pt;left:36pt;padding-bottom:0.04em;">This paper and the included study had several limitations that were realized and properly </span><br /><span class="tx" style="top:303.65pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;">accounted for. First, student learning and course outcomes are fairly serious metrics. Therefore, </span> <span class="tx" style="top:331.25pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;padding-right:3.19em;">it was not possible to perform this study on an active class. The study emulated a single </span> <span class="tx" style="top:358.87pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;padding-right:0.83em;">assignment rather than attempting to differentiate and study presentation medium in an active </span> <span class="tx" style="top:386.47pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;padding-right:0.56em;">course. Second, due to resource constraints as well as a lack of access to active courses, it was </span> <span class="tx" style="top:414.07pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;">not possible to have a massive participation in the study, and therefore the number of participants </span> <span class="tx" style="top:441.67pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:0.04em;padding-right:34.03em;">was limited. </span><br /><span class="tx" style="top:469.27pt;left:36pt;padding-bottom:0.04em;">There were also a number of delimitations that affected the study. First, in order to attract </span><br /><span class="tx" style="top:496.87pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;">participants, the content selected for testing was relatively short, and not necessarily </span> <span class="tx" style="top:524.5pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;">representative of an actual assignment in an educational setting. Second, in order to streamline </span> <span class="tx" style="top:552.1pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;">the process of attracting participants and gathering consent, the study was limited to participants </span> <span class="tx" style="top:579.7pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:1.44em;padding-right:1.19em;">over the age of 18, thus meaning the study does not necessarily reflect the results that may be </span> <span class="tx" style="top:607.3pt;left:0pt;padding-bottom:0.04em;padding-right:1.63em;">found in a K-12 environment. Third, as an additional method of increasing participation, the </span><br /></div>
