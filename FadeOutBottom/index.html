		<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF LECTURE PRESENTATION MEDIUM</strong><br />
		
		<p>This research explores how the medium used to present content in an online course may impact student learning and comprehension. As Massively Open Online Courses (MOOC) become a new model for education, the impact of the medium in which content is presented may become increasingly important. This research studied whether content presented as a video is more effective at achieving student learning than the same content presented as written text. Participants were over 100 adults who received professional development training. Each participant in the study was shown one piece of content solely as video and another solely as text. There were four combinations of tests. The combinations included two pieces of content presented using two forms of media, video or text. Each participant experienced each piece of content in opposite media. After each piece of content they were asked to answer comprehension questions. Their scores on each piece of content were then compared to one another. Following the individual analysis, groups who experienced identical content (i.e. Lecture A in video) were compared to the inverse group (Lecture A in text). Data from the study is presented using bar graphs and charts detailing the comparisons. The results seemed to indicate there may be a benefit to the studentâ€™s learning when experiencing content as video compared to when content is simply presented as text. As no test of significance was performed, the results cannot be generalized.</p><br />
