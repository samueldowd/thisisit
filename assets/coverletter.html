          	<h2>Dear Viewer,</h2>
          	<p>Thank you for your interest in my experience as a candidate for the degree of Master of Education in Educational Technology at Framingham State University. It has been a journey, as most graduate programs are intended to be. Over the course of the program I have worked in three very different jobs, at three companies, and in three industries. While all very different, they all provided ample opportunity to practice and develop the skills that I learned over the course of the 10 courses that I took.</p>
          	<p>I began the program in the fall of 2011 when I was a Technology Integration Specialist at Hopkinton High School. While I did not have a class of students, I was responsible for teaching the teachers how to use technology effectively and in ways that would not only be flashy and exciting, but also improve student outcomes. This work was very exciting and really provided me with a great lens through which to approach my studies, particularly at the outset.</p>
          	<p>Halfway through the spring of 2012 I took a new job as a Technology Consultant at Harvard Business School. In this job I had many responsibilities, but one of the constants in my time there was training. From group training of staff, to individual trainings with the HBS faculty who were often world-renowned experts in their field. This was completely different from teaching High School Teachers. But it also had its similarities that I found through some of the field work that I did.</p>
          	<p>In the summer of 2013 I left Harvard Business School to join McGraw-Hill Education's newly formed Digital Platforms Group. The new division was tasked with bringing the well-known publishing from print to digital. In particular I was working in the research and development arm of that group. This provided a great opportunity to take a step back from the actual instruction, and look at it from an outside perspective. As I worked on different projects and products, it was important for me to understand what teachers were looking for and how to best serve their needs. My experience in this program was invaluable in that effort. From being able to collaborate and exchange ideas with educators I was able to get an inside look at the current state of educational technology. Perhaps more importantly I was able to get a sense for the direction that the educational system in this country as a whole is heading. With more and more schools adopting the Common Core, and needing to show student learning outcomes as matched up to particular standards, the traditional idea of the "teacher" was changing. It was great to be able to keep up with that change through interaction with my classmates.</p>
          	<p>As I mentioned earlier, the field work that I did was particularly exciting and helpful in getting a more full and practical understanding of educational technology and its role in education as a whole. For the sake of this portion of the portfolio, I'd like to specifically address three of the most useful fieldwork exercises. The first was a webquest that I developed in Don Langenhorst's Internet for 21st Century Teaching and Learning. At the time I was working at Harvard Business School. I was tasked with a project that involved researching and presenting options for a cloud storage and collaboration service. I was asked to work with a team and evaluate several options, and then prepare a presentation for the IT Group's executive team based on our findings. This was a perfect situation to use a webquest. I designed a webquest using Google Sites that was adapted slightly to be appropriate for a classroom assignment. This webquest guided a group of students through the process of forming a team, identifying roles based on individual skills and abilities, conducting and documenting research, and developing a summative presentation. While the webquest was useful to make just to learn the process and add a new type of assignment to my repertoire, it also helped me approach the project at work. I used some of the team role division steps from the webquest when the team was initially created. I used the evaluation method, a SWOT analysis, to guide the team in their research and come up with useful results from their research. And finally the rubric that I incorporated in the webquest was how I guided our team in creating the presentation. As we brainstormed and eventually began planning the presentation I was able to consult the rubric from the webquest to assure that we were creating an effective presentation that would not only convey information but engage the audience, and provide a thorough understanding of the options. In the end, I was successful with the project at work, and that was due in large part to the development of the webquest for this course.</p>
          	<p>The next fieldwork assignment that I enjoyed was the research paper that I wrote for Deborah Merriam's Research and Evaluation class. This research involved carefully following the steps needed to write a research report. From a proposal to the final product we were guided through the process and had the opportunity to interact with our peers to provide and receive feedback along the way. My research was on the effect that presentaion medium (specifically video lectures vs. text lectures) impacts student learning in online courses. The study that I developed involved participants watching a video and then reading a text, each followed by five comprehension questions. The process of coming up with the research, identifying limitations and delimitations, as well as analyzing and reporting on the results was actually fun. I enjoyed getting a sense of the effectiveness of video in education, and also exploring other studies and research on the topic. This class certainly helped me to learn the process of action research, using the mixed-method approach, how to construct research methods that produced reliable results, and much more. However, the fact that each of us was able to identify a topic related to our field was particularly helpful. In that way I not only learned how to write a research paper, but also got to learn a lot about the world of educational technology, online courses, and how to present course materials effectively. By conducting my own research out in the field and then drawing my own conclusions from the research I was able to learn a lot of great information that was then applied directly to some of the products I was working on at McGraw-Hill Education.</p>
          	<p>The third field experience I'd like to mention is the work I did for Loy Riley's Language Development and Communication. For this research I actually visited an elementary school and spent some time with the speech/language pathologist at the school. While I was there she met with several of the students that she usually worked with. I had the opportunity to observe and work with a hispanic student who was struggling with learning English and being able to pronounce words correctly. This experience was helpful in several ways, but in particular it was helpful in how I approached my course on Assistive Technology, and also my work at the time with adults with difficulty speaking English. By experiencing a speech therapy session, and learning the theories of the profession, as well as the strategies and interventions that can be done, I was able to understand the concepts and ultimately the intended objectives of the course much more easily.</p>
          	<p>In all, over the course of three years, and through ten classes, I have learned a lot. Both from the material taught within the confines of the online structure, but also through fieldwork and group projects. All three allowed me to gain a unique insight into education, and afforded me the opportunity to learn from both the faculty and my peers. In addition, I got to learn about education in general through the core courses. While the Instructional Technology courses were very engaging and helpful to my profession, the education courses helped me understand the broader education community. They helped me understand more about how to interact with students, how to approach teaching methods and practices in ways that are most effective for students, and also find out what my strengths and weaknesses are as an educator.</p>
          	<p>I look forward to completing my degree in May, but will certainly find myself looking for ways to continue learning about this area of education. It has become a great passion for me, and with this degree, and more importantly the work I've done and the instruction I received, all represented here in this portfolio, I will be able to make a significant and tangible contribution to the use of technology in education.</p>
